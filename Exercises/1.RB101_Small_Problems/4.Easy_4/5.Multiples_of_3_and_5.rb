#Problem: Multiples of 3 and 5
  Write a method that searches for all multiples of 3 or 5 that lie between 1 and some other number,
  and then computes the sum of those multiples. For instance, if the supplied number is 20, the result
  should be 98 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20).
  You may assume that the number passed in is an integer greater than 1.

  Explicit requirements
    Input:
      -integer
    Output:
      -integer
    Rules:
      - must find multiples of 3 && 5
      - multiples must be between 1 and given num
      - must compute sum of the multiples
      - assume number passed is > 1

  Implicit requirements:
