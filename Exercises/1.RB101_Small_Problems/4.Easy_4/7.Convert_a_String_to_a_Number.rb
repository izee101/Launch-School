#Problem: Convert a String to a Number!
  The String#to_i method converts a string of numeric characters (including an optional
  plus or minus sign) to an Integer. String#to_i and the Integer constructor (Integer())
  behave similarly. In this exercise, you will create a method that does the same thing.

Write a method that takes a String of digits, and returns the appropriate number as an
integer. You may not use any of the methods mentioned above.

For now, do not worry about leading + or - signs, nor should you worry about invalid
  characters; assume all characters will be numeric.

You may not use any of the standard conversion methods available in Ruby to convert a
string to a number, such as String#to_i, Integer(), etc. Your method should do this the
old-fashioned way and calculate the result by analyzing the characters in the string.

  Explicit requirements
    Input:
      - string
    Output:
      - integer
    Rules:
      -cannot use String#to_i, Integer(), etc...

  Implicit requirements:
    -

  Questions:
    -Invalid characters? = IGNORE
    -Negative numbers? = IGNORE

#Examples / Test Cases:
